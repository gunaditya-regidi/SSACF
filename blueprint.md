# Age Care Foundation - Website Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing the Age Care Foundation website, a modern and responsive platform built with Laravel. The website will serve as a central hub for information about the foundation, its services, and how to get involved.

## Current Implemented Features

*   **Home Page:** A welcoming and informative landing page that provides an overview of the foundation's mission and services.
*   **Services Pages:** Dedicated pages for each of the foundation's services, including Geriatric Care, Palliative Care, Dementia Care, and more.
*   **About Us Pages:** Pages that provide information about the foundation's mission, approach, team, and journey.
*   **Blog:** A blog section with articles and updates about the foundation's work.
*   **Contact Page:** A simple and user-friendly contact form for users to get in touch with the foundation.

## Current Task: Update "Geriatric Care" Page

### Plan

1.  **Update `GeriatricCareController.php`:** I have updated the `highlightCards` and `faqs` arrays in the `GeriatricCareController` to include the new content provided by the user.
2.  **Update `geriatric-care.blade.php`:** I have modified the `geriatric-care.blade.php` file to display the updated highlight cards and FAQs, and to update the main description of the page.
3.  **Adjust Layout:** I've adjusted the layout of the highlight cards to be in a grid of three columns, and styled them to be consistent with the Palliative Care page.
