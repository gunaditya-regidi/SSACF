# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application for the Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation, built with Laravel. The application is designed to showcase the foundation's mission, services, and journey through a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing interface. It features a blog, news and events section, detailed service pages, and an extensive gallery.

## Style, Design, and Features

### General

*   **Layout:** The application uses a responsive, single-column layout with a consistent header and footer across all pages.
*   **Typography:** The primary font is Figtree, with a clean and readable style. Headings are bold and oversized to create a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme is centered around a professional and trustworthy blue, with accents of gray and white.
*   **Navigation:** The main navigation bar provides easy access to all key sections of the site, including Home, About, Services, and more.

### Key Features

*   **Blog:** A fully functional blog with individual post pages and a main listing page.
*   **News and Events:** A dedicated section for news articles and upcoming events, with a dynamic, filterable layout.
*   **Service Pages:** Detailed pages for each of the foundation's services, including Palliative Care, Geriatric Care, and more.
*   **Our Journey:** An interactive timeline showcasing the foundation's history and key milestones.
*   **Gallery:** A visually rich gallery with high-quality images and a clean, grid-based layout.
*   **FAQ Section:** A dedicated FAQ page with expandable answers for a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Current Change: Text Justification

### Plan and Steps

*   **Objective:** Justify the text content in the "Books," "FAQ," and "Articles" sections to create a more polished and professional appearance.
*   **Steps Completed:**
    1.  **Justify FAQ Answers:** Modified the `faq-item.blade.php` component to apply `text-align: justify;` to the FAQ answer text.
    2.  **Justify "Our Journey" Descriptions:** Updated the `our-journey-content.blade.php` component to justify the description text for each milestone.
    3.  **Justify "Advocacy and Training" Descriptions:** Applied `text-align: justify;` to the description text in the highlight cards on the `advocacy-and-training.blade.php` page.
    4.  **Justify "Our Approach" Descriptions:** Added an inline style to justify the text content in the "Holistic Care Approach," "Family Care Approach," and "Celebrating Life" sections of the `our-approach.blade.php` component.

I have now addressed all the initial requests and have created a `blueprint.md` file to document the project's current state. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
