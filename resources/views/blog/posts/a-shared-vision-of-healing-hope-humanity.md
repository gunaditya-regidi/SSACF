On 11 November 2025, Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation advanced its mission with another decisive milestone as South Asia LPG Company Pvt. Ltd. (SALPG) extended CSR support towards the development of Level-2 of the Inpatient Wing (C-Block) at its Integrated Palliative & Geriatric Care Facility.

Recognised as India’s foremost LPG logistics company—delivering advanced storage and logistics solutions to oil marketing companies and private enterprises—SALPG’s support enabled the expansion of critical care infrastructure, adding 16 well-equipped inpatient rooms, nursing stations, and essential clinical facilities. This development is not merely an addition of bricks and beds; it is a strategic reinforcement of compassionate, patient-centric care for the elderly and individuals living with life-limiting illnesses.

### Corporate Responsibility with Real Impact

Sharing her perspective on the collaboration, Richa Shinde, Managing Director & CEO of SALPG, underscored the company’s conviction that corporate responsibility must move beyond intent and translate into measurable, meaningful social impact. The partnership reflects SALPG’s commitment to initiatives that create long-term value for society by addressing some of its most sensitive healthcare needs.

### Strengthening Care Where It Matters Most

For Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation, this support carries deep significance. G. Sambasiva Rao, Chairman, and N. S. Raju, Managing Trustee, expressed heartfelt gratitude to SALPG, noting that the assistance has substantially strengthened the Foundation’s capacity to deliver dignified, safe, and comforting care during the most fragile moments of patients’ lives.

### The Bigger Picture

With Level-2 of C-Block progressing, Sneha Sandhya continues to scale its integrated care model—one that blends clinical excellence with empathy. The collaboration with SALPG stands as a powerful example of how aligned CSR vision and healthcare expertise can create sustainable impact, reinforcing a shared commitment to healing, hope, and humanity.

This milestone reaffirms a simple truth: when purpose-driven institutions and responsible corporates come together, care transcends infrastructure and becomes a lifeline.
