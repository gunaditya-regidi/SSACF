Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation has crossed a defining inflection point with the inauguration of Level-1, Block-C of its Integrated Palliative and Geriatric Care Facility—an initiative enabled through the Platinum CSR partnership of Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) under its flagship healthcare program, KVB Aarogya.

The facility was formally inaugurated on 10 November 2025 by B. Ramesh Babu, MD & CEO, Karur Vysya Bank Ltd., in the presence of senior leadership, CSR representatives, regional managers, doctors, and staff—collectively underscoring a shared commitment to inclusive, humane healthcare.

### What This Wing Delivers—At Scale

The newly commissioned Level-1, C-Block is a fully enabled inpatient wing comprising:

- 16 inpatient rooms
- Two nursing stations
- Essential clinical infrastructure

This wing is purpose-built to deliver a continuum of care, including Geriatric Care, Palliative Care, Respite Care, Rehabilitative & Transitional Care, Day Care, Dementia Care, and Hospice Care—ensuring dignity, comfort, and clinical excellence at every stage of illness and ageing.

### Leadership Perspective

G. Sambasiva Rao, Chairman, highlighted that this launch marks a landmark moment for palliative care in Andhra Pradesh, acknowledging KVB’s role as a catalyst in translating vision into impact.

N. S. Raju, Managing Trustee, expressed deep gratitude for the Bank’s timely and strategic support, emphasizing how the partnership accelerates service delivery for the seriously ill and the elderly—where outcomes are measured not just in recovery, but in compassion.

From KVB’s leadership, Sri B. Ramesh Babu reaffirmed that the Bank’s CSR philosophy prioritizes inclusive healthcare for vulnerable populations, backing initiatives that combine empathy with operational rigor.

### A Collective Commitment

The inauguration witnessed active participation from KVB’s CSR team, regional managers to branch managers, along with Sneha Sandhya’s former trustees, advisory board members, clinicians, and care teams—a unified front signaling long-term stewardship rather than one-time sponsorship.

### Bottom Line

This launch is not ceremonial—it’s operational. With Block-C now live, Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation has materially expanded its capacity to serve those who need it most. Backed by Karur Vysya Bank’s CSR leadership, this facility sets a new benchmark for integrated palliative and geriatric care in the region—where compassion meets execution, and dignity remains non-negotiable.
