Visakhapatnam | 5–6 December 2025

Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation marked a strategic milestone in its advocacy and academic engagement by successfully co-hosting DemCon’25, a two-day national conference on dementia care, in collaboration with GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. The conference was organized by the Dementia India Alliance and held at Visakhapatnam on 5th and 6th December 2025.

DemCon’25 convened an eminent, multidisciplinary cohort of geriatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists, palliative care specialists, nurses, psychologists, social workers, caregivers, and allied health professionals from across the country—creating a high-impact national forum for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

### Academic Depth with Clinical Relevance

The conference featured keynote addresses, plenary sessions, panel discussions, and interactive case-based deliberations led by distinguished national faculty. Scientific discourse focused on contemporary and real-world challenges, including:

- Dementia diagnosis and management

- Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)

- Advance care planning and communication strategies

- Integration of palliative care principles into dementia care

DemCon’25 emerged as a credible academic and advocacy platform dedicated to comprehensive, ethical, and compassionate dementia care, with a strong emphasis on palliative and end-of-life care, legal and ethical considerations, caregiver support, and multidisciplinary care models.

### Putting Humanity at the Center of Care

A defining hallmark of DemCon’25 was its deliberate focus on the human, social, and ethical dimensions of dementia. Sessions consistently underscored dignity, comfort, and quality of life for persons living with dementia, while candidly addressing the emotional and physical burden borne by caregivers. The need for robust, community-based support systems was reinforced as a non-negotiable pillar of sustainable dementia care.

### Leadership & Policy Perspective

The valedictory session was graced by Muthukumilli Sribharat, Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha – Visakhapatnam Constituency). In his address, he appreciated the organizers for hosting a timely and nationally relevant conference on a condition of growing concern in India’s rapidly ageing population. He emphasized the imperative to strengthen geriatric and dementia care services and called for deeper collaboration between healthcare professionals, institutions, and policymakers to ensure dignified care for senior citizens.

### Institutional Support

DemCon’25 was hosted with the gracious support of GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences, Visakhapatnam, whose infrastructure and hospitality played a critical role in the seamless execution of the conference.

### Commitment Beyond the Conference

Through DemCon’25, Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation reaffirmed its long-term commitment to education, capacity building, and advocacy in geriatric, dementia, and palliative care—aligned squarely with its mission to serve the elderly with compassion and dignity.

The conference concluded with a shared resolve among participants to translate knowledge into practice, strengthen professional networks, and work collectively to ensure that dementia care in India is not only clinically sound, but deeply humane.
